# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

VIRP is a security-critical protocol. If you discover a vulnerability in the cryptographic verification path, chain integrity, HMAC signing, or trust tier enforcement:

**Do NOT open a public issue.**

Email: nhoward@thirdlevelit.com

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a timeline for remediation.

## Scope

The following are in scope for security reports:

- HMAC-SHA256 signing bypass or forgery
- Trust tier escalation (e.g., RED command executing as GREEN)
- Chain database tampering without detection
- O-Node socket authentication bypass
- Device credential exposure through the API layer
- Session handshake state machine violations

## Out of Scope

- Denial of service against the O-Node (known limitation — single-process architecture)
- Issues requiring physical access to the host machine
- Social engineering

## Socket Peer Authentication

The O-Node Unix domain socket is gated by `SO_PEERCRED` (Linux). VIRP
currently supports Linux only; the BSD `getpeereid` equivalent is not
implemented. Every `accept()` reads the connecting process's UID and
compares it against a startup-loaded allowlist:

- `VIRP_ALLOWED_UIDS` — comma-separated UID list (e.g. `VIRP_ALLOWED_UIDS=0,1001`)
- Prod builds also honor `socket_allowed_uids` in the JSON config
- If neither is set, the allowlist defaults to the daemon's own
  effective UID — closed to every other local user

Rejected connections are closed immediately without reading any bytes
and produce a single `REJECTED connection: peer uid=...` log line.

The socket itself is created mode 0660 atomically via `umask(0117)` set
around `bind()` (with a belt-and-suspenders `chmod(0660)` after), so
there is no window in which a world-accessible node exists on disk.

## Trust Boundaries and Transport Paths

VIRP defines two distinct paths that reach the O-Node. Their protections
are not the same, and a protection that applies to one does not
automatically apply to the other.

**Local Unix domain socket** — `/run/virp/onode.sock` (prod) or
`/tmp/virp-onode.sock` (dev). Protected by:

- `SO_PEERCRED` peer-UID allowlist (see previous section) — the kernel
  reports the caller's real UID, which is checked against the
  startup-loaded allowlist before any bytes are read.
- Filesystem mode `0660` with ownership restricted to the daemon's
  service user/group.
- VIRP message-layer session handshake (`SESSION_HELLO` /
  `SESSION_HELLO_ACK` with nonces, followed by HKDF session-key
  derivation) on every fresh connection.
- HMAC-SHA256 signing of every observation returned to the caller,
  using an O-Key the caller does not possess.

**TCP path (CT 210 dashboard ↔ CT 211 O-Node, ports 9998/9999)** — the
dashboard's `virp-bridge.py` listens on TCP 9998 locally on CT 210 and
opens a TCP connection to CT 211:9999, where a socat forwarder proxies
to the Unix socket. On this path:

- `SO_PEERCRED` sees the local socat process's UID, **not** the remote
  dashboard's identity. It cannot distinguish authorized dashboard
  traffic from any other process on CT 211 that can reach the socat
  forwarder.
- The VIRP message-layer session handshake and HMAC signing of
  observations still apply — observations returned across the TCP
  bridge are signed at collection time with the O-Key and are as
  verifiable as on the local path. An attacker who intercepts or
  injects on the TCP path cannot forge observations without the O-Key.
- The TCP path itself is **not** currently TLS-protected, and the
  session handshake authenticates session establishment via nonce
  exchange but does not cryptographically bind to a TCP endpoint
  identity. Confidentiality, integrity of requests in flight, and
  mutual authentication of the two containers currently rely on:
  - W1 egress isolation (CT 210 can reach only allowlisted ports on
    CT 211),
  - network segmentation between the two containers,
  - the O-Key's secrecy on CT 211 (observations remain unforgeable
    even if the request channel is compromised).

**Open work.** TCP-path mutual authentication — either mTLS between
the dashboard bridge and the socat endpoint, or request-side signing
at the VIRP message layer — is not yet implemented and is tracked as
follow-up hardening.
